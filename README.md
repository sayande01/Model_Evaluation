### Title
Understanding Key Metrics in Machine Learning: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, TPR, FPR, and ROC Curve

### Description
This notebook delves into fundamental metrics used in evaluating machine learning models: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, True Positive Ratio (TPR), False Positive Ratio (FPR), and the ROC Curve. Each metric plays a crucial role in understanding the performance of classification models. The notebook provides detailed explanations, calculations, and visualizations to illustrate these concepts effectively.

### Objective
The objective of this notebook is to:
1. Explain the concepts of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, True Positive Ratio (TPR), False Positive Ratio (FPR), and the ROC Curve.
2. Demonstrate the importance and use-cases of each metric in evaluating classification models.
3. Provide practical examples and visualizations to enhance understanding.
4. Equip readers with the knowledge to interpret and apply these metrics in their own machine learning projects.
